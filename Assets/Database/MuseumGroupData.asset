  description: Howard Thurman, a prominent theologian, author, and civil rights leader,
    spent his childhood in a modest home in Daytona Beach, Florida. Born in 1899,
    Thurman grew up in a racially segregated America and experienced the challenges
    of that era. The house was a humble yet nurturing environment where he was raised
    by his grandmother, Nancy Ambrose, who instilled in him a strong sense of faith
    and resilience. This modest home played a significant role in shaping Thurman's
    early years and the values that would later inspire his work as a leader in the
    struggle for racial equality and social justice.
